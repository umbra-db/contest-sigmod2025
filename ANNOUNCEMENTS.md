# Announcements

### 2025-02-27
  - The recently pushed GitHub workflow will automatically compile, test, and benchmark your solution on all four systems
  - Check your repository's pull requests
  - The results are currently shown at https://sigmod-contest-25.hpi-sci.de/ and will soon be published on the official contest website

### 2025-03-04
  - With today's changes to the main repository you forked from, we improved the performance of the evaluation phase
  - **Important notes:**
    - **Deadline change:** The deadline for the final submission has been extended to March 31
    - **Own source files**: The CMake file (which cannot be modified by participants) now includes all *.cpp fiels in the `src` directory. This way, you can add your own source files and better structure your code.
    - **Third-party library:** We found that some teams use third-party libraries, e.g., for  logging. Please note that third-party libraries are not allowed in the contest. You are free to use them during development, but you need to remove them prior to the final submission. Otherwise, your submission is disqualified.
